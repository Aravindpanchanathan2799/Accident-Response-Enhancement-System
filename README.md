# AidConnect - AI-Powered Accident Response System  

## Inspiration
Emergency response is **often delayed**, leading to **preventable fatalities** and **inefficient hospital triage**. Our team wanted to **bridge the gap between accident witnesses, first responders, and hospitals** by leveraging **AI, NLP, and Computer Vision** to ensure **faster, smarter emergency care**.  

**Why is this important?**  
- **50% of trauma-related deaths** occur within the **first 60 minutes** due to delays.  
- **40% of witnesses hesitate or fail** to report accidents effectively.  
- **30% of ER visits result in misallocation of medical resources** due to lack of pre-arrival triage.

**AidConnect ensures structured emergency reporting and AI-driven hospital coordination to save lives!**   

## What it does
AidConnect is an **AI-powered accident response enhancement system** that:  
**Allows witnesses to report accidents in real time** via **SOS alert, voice, text, or images**. 
**Uses NLP & Computer Vision to assess injury severity** and **predict affected body parts**.
**Integrates Google Gemini AI** to **recommend hospitals and provide first-aid instructions**.
**Notifies hospitals in advance** with AI-driven **triage details for faster patient care**. 
**AI-enhanced decision-making** for quicker **emergency response and hospital coordination**.  

**Key AI Features**  
- **NLP extracts injured body parts** from accident descriptions.  
- **Computer Vision models classify injury severity** from uploaded images.  
- **Google Gemini AI suggests nearest hospitals & first aid instructions**.

 **Tech Stack Integration**  
- Frontend: **React.js + Tailwind CSS** for an intuitive UI.  
- Backend: **Flask (AI processing) + Express.js (API management)**.  
- AI: **NLP, Computer Vision & Google Gemini AI**.  
- Deployment: **Docker for containerization & cloud scalability**
